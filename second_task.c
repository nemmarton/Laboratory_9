/* Task description:
Dynamic extension of strings

The strcat() function located in string.h header file concatenates two strings: the strcat(x, y) call adds string y to the end of string x. 
For the correct operation, the array behind x must be long enough to accomodate the letters of y, too, otherwise the function overindexes the array usually leading to a crash. 
It is the responsibility of the caller to ensure that the array behind x is big enough, which makes the use of this function rather inconvinient.

Your task is to create a more sophisticated function to concatenate two strings. The first parameter must be a dynamic string! 
This function should be used like x = stringcat(x, y), hence it does not add the letters y to x, but it creates a new array of appropriate size dynamically, 
assembles the concatenated string there, releases the dynamic memory of the received x and returns the pointer pointing to the new string. 
For instance:

char *x;
x = copystring("apple");  /* from the previous task */
x = stringcat(x, "tree");
printf("%s\n", x);    // appletree

free(x);

Now you should write this function. Add a comment above it describing the purpose and the usage of the function! Don't forget to mention in the comment that the first parameter of the function must be dynamically allocated.

Hint:
Why does the function return the address of the resulting concatenated string? Because the concatenated string consumes more memory, a new memory allocation is needed, thus string x is relocated in the memory. The original string x is released (that's why x must be allocated dynamically - we need to be able to free it), and the new location is returned.
