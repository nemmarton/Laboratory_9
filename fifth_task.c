/* Task description:Inserting strings into strings

This task is similar to the previous ones: the function receives a string, and creates a new one.

This time, however, the task is not to remove/cut something from a string, but to insert another string to somewhere into the original string. 
For instance, the result of insertstring("hello!", 5, ", world") is a new string containing hello, world!: the second string has been inserted between letters "o" and "!".
