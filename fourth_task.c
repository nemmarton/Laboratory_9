/* Task description:Removing parts from strings
Visit HP too!

Write the inverse of the previous function: the part delimited by the start and end indices should be removed from the original text, and the rest is kept! 
The function should not modify the source string received as a parameter, a brand new string should be created dynamically, and returned by the function.

Write a C program to demonstrate the usage of the function. Don't forget to release the memory at the end.
