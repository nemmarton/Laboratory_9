/* Task description:
Please visit the homepage for more detail and visuals
Write a function that receives a string and copies only a part of it, specified by a starting and an ending index! (The received string must be intact.) 
The start index is the position of the first character to keep and the end index is the position of the first character that it not to keep. (Hence, the interval is closed from the left and open from the right).
When the start index is less than 0, or the end index is greater than the length of the string, write an error message to the screen before returning with invalid pointer! 
The function should return with the address of a dynamically allocated string containing the substring to keep.
